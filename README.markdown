# How to compile (Linux)

To compile, you need to install at least the following packages:

    libopenal-dev libsdl1.2-dev

Then simply issue good ol'

    make

To play, you need the game's resources, more specifically the following directories:

- animation
- level
- music
- replay (may be empty)
- sound
- texture
- tile01 ... tile07

Copy them into this directory and run `./gish`.
